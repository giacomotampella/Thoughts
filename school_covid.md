## I want to clarify that what you will read is my thought, which changes over time, but which I wanted to fix.


Two words about the school at the time of Covid-19.

I immediately state one very important thing. Indeed 2.

1) Covid was an unexpected event;
2) School is the most important thing, together with health, that a state has to think about.

So, with these things said, let's get started.

The last day of "freedom", or rather, of "normal life" was March 7, 2020. Even if we had already been hearing about this virus that was traveling for about a month.
The 7th of March, however, was to all intents and purposes the last day lived like everyone else, since from the following day, everyone was locked in the house. Literally.

Obviously among the "everyone" there were also us students, who, from one day to the next, saw our schools close. For obvious reasons.
And so, teenagers, children etc ... from 3 to 2? years have found themselves locked in the house. Not to do anything, mind you; to follow the lessons at a distance.

Now let's pause for a second. We try to identify with a little boy / child. Let's try to understand it. (I, like maybe some of you, don't have to make this effort as a 17-year-old boy, at the time 16).
It is impossible to understand, if you have not experienced it in person, the terrible moment that we (students) spent in that period.

So overnight schools closed.
For one / two weeks no school at all, not being ready yet and not knowing what to do yet.
It all sounds nice, yes. But let's wait for the end to draw conclusions.

It is logical that it could not have been done otherwise. Closing everything was the most immediate and logical action to take. We were officially part of a global pandemic.

(Now I speak in the first person, giving my example, since it is easier for me. You customize it to your liking.).

And so I finish second high school, at home. In my bedroom.
Right where I am writing this Thought now.
I pass and spend exactly 3 months, or 1/3 of a school year, at home. Without ever leaving my garden. Never seeing anyone but my parents and my brother.
Yes, some video calls with friends. But nothing.

FINALLY comes summer. After a year like this it took. And how if it was needed.
I leave home for the first time after 3 months of segregation (I don't criticize them, and I'm the first to say they were essential). I see my friends. All beautiful.

I can even say that this summer, Summer-2020, was perhaps the most experienced, most desired summer.
I still remember one evening, at the house of a friend of mine (there were 4 of us), when we said: "this summer we deserved it all, we needed it.". Very true.

I have to be honest, for a few moments I even forgot what Covid was. Yes, because in the end this was a summer more or less like any other.

September arrives. And we start talking about school (in time I would say ...). We all want to go back to school. First of all, we students. And I want to underline it.

As a good student I am, I imagined that within the Ministry of Education they had spent a very busy summer, having to plan the return to school of all the students of Italy.
But no. What a childish mind is it? Adults are right to say to us (kids): "But what do you know. You are too young". Absolutely.

Then maybe I say to myself: "maybe they didn't need all summer; they are adults, they need less time to finalize and think about things.". Sure.
And they come up with the most brilliant idea in the history of my state. Given that, however, with the end of summer and the gradual lowering of temperatures, Covid was recovering its footing,
there would be back to school, but always with the usual rules: mask and spacing.

Here comes the idea of ideas, where the human mind has exceeded all limits. Benches with wheels.
Help, just to pronounce it, not even to write it, it hurts me.

119 million euros were spent on benches, which instead of traditional legs, have wheels. Here, I don't spend a word more here,
to have to explain the uselessness of these gadgets, as well as the uselessness of the person who wanted them. I don't mention names (you know who). Not to mention the millions spent.
In short, excellent.

Instead, I as a poor naive and, aware of the fact that 6 months of pandemic were few and that there would be a sequel, I had hypothesized that the state had a plan, an idea for a possible relapse into a national lockdown with closed schools. But even here, I was wrong.
And I believed that in the summer months the state had thought about how to improve, make DAD (a term I hate deeply) more effective and more "pleasant".
Here too I was wrong.

On one thing, however, no.

I knew very well that Covid was not over. Do you know how I knew? No, I haven't had any contact with Bill Gates or Elon Musk.

I simply used a discipline. Discipline that I do not like, but that those older than me make me study by saying that it is useful in life.
But perhaps I have understood its true usefulness and exploit it, while they have not.

The discipline in question is history.

"History is useful, it helps not to repeat the same mistakes made in the past.", Well, then use it.

A very simple thing I understand. Although man evolves, and makes his available means (technology) evolve, a pandemic remains a pandemic. And it too evolves.

I realized that 6 months of Covid was not all. I realized there would be more after that. And so it was.
Let's look back. We look and analyze the pandemics that have swept the earth in the past centuries / millennia. 6 months and it's all over? Absolutely not.

Closed this parenthesis, let's return to us.

Mid-September and back to school. For the first month, everything was fine. I felt like I was going back to living my life as before. I took the bus, I talked to my friends.


Sure, with the mask and all, but at least I saw and lived a semblance of normality.

October arrives, and with the arrival of autumn, the cases begin to grow fearfully. Second wave starts. Official.

Schools are closing, and I find myself in the same condition (not a comma has changed) of 7 months before. Same. In another of my thoughts I said how school does not evolve. This is one example.

And now I'm here, April 9, 2021. More than a year after everything started. But to live as I lived more than a year ago.

One thing is clear. I am one of those people who, if they say not to leave the house, I do not go out. I am one of those people who believes that lockdown was the solution.

I think there is little to joke about on the subject of Health. It comes first.

But on the upper floors they only think of one thing: let's reopen as soon as possible. And tell me how such a reasoning can work.

I lived for 2 months, a continuous stressful and tired open-close of school. They think those back-to-school weeks benefited me, if the week
Did I find myself home again afterwards? Don't they think that greater continuity could bring more order and be much more useful to us students?

Maybe they don't know that what they do is death. Maybe they don't know that the life of the world is not theirs. Perhaps they do not know that the life of the world is given by young people.
Maybe they don't understand that what they are doing is killing the future.

Do you often hear it true? "The future is the young.". Keep saying it but don't think it. You will notice the consequences.

Now, why am I writing this Thought?

Because I have just discovered, today, Friday 9 April 2021 at 6:30 pm, that from Monday I will go back to school, because my region has gone from the red zone to the orange zone.
(If you don't know what they are, just search the internet for the red / orange area of Italy at the time of Covid-19).
With a lot of notice I discover that in 3 days I go back to school. I will spend the last month of school in a horrible, stressful and tiring way. Full of checks and queries.

Well, like that.

I am of the idea that this past and this experience will bring many fruits and finally to an evolution of the school. Because when we (now 17 years old) will be at the head of the various states,
we will remember what we went through and lived through. Of this I am happy. I am happy for my children, as when they are born, they will become the most important thing and the real life of the world.
Not me anymore.
As usual I have not written everything. So many thoughts come and go in my Mind. Especially when it comes to issues that I care a lot, such as the School.

Well. Thanks for your time.

bye ;)
